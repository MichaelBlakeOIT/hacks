# Hacks

This is a collection of tools I've written, generally for one of two reasons:

1. To get things done.
2. To learn something new.

Code quality, functionality, and support are all best effort :).

## Thanks

As mentioned above, much of this repo is me figuring things out and/or solving problems. When I've used someone else's idea as a jumping off point I try to make a point of thanking them, but if I've accidentally missed someone, please don't take it personally and let me know.

That said, a huge amount of what is in here has been the result of @tomnomnom's open-by-default way of doing things. I've learned a **ton** from reading through his code and watching his streams, which was the entire reason for me cleaning up my private cruft and releasing it here. Thanks, Tom!
